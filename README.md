### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a writer and designer.

My purpose is wrestling the alligator of complexity in order to deliver simple, powerful experiences that help people do things. 

I combine strategic thinking with a deep reservoir of empathy to turn challenging products into comprehensible and delightful user experiences. Currently, I'm exploring how to use data and machine learning to tell even better stories.

Formerly: Yelp, Asana, Google, and Zendesk.
