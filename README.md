### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I help simplify user experiences using language and design.

My approach uses a mix of storytelling techniques, human-centered design principles, and psychology. I am interested in software that helps humans make and do things, because tools literally change the way we perceive the world.

Formerly: Yelp, Asana, Google, and Zendesk.
